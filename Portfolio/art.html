      <h2>GOTCHA! You thought you'd learn more. Hah. Here's part of an essay I did about my favorite art piece of all time</h2><br>
      <div class="flex-grid-thirds">

        <div class="col" style="background:none;">
          <p>Butcher Boys was made in 1986 by artist, Jane Alexander. Reinforced plaster, animal bone, horns, oil paint, and a wooden bench were used to create this piece. (Horror Histories, pg.2) This contemporary art piece was inspired by the ‘dehumanizing effects of Apartheid’. (SA History, pg.1)  Apartheid was a law that segregated whites, blacks, and colored/asians in South Africa. (History, pg.1) Non-whites were forced to carry passes with them at all times to show authorization in a certain area, interracial marriages were illegal and classifications of race were always changing. Alexander was raised during a time of educational, social, and political discrimination. The school systems were tailored differently for whites and non-whites. Whites had the opportunity to strive for greatness, while the non-whites were given limited chances of even attending school. Through this law the government was looking to separate these groups to diminish their political power. Someone like Alexander didn’t necessarily get the bad end of the stick. Since Alexander is a white female she wasn’t negatively affected by this law. So does this question her authenticity? Or does her art give a voice to those that weren’t allowed a voice.
</p>
          <p>Her art piece consists of three mutilated male demonic figures that are sitting on a bench. Each form is pale, muscular, earless, mouthless and hairless. Representing beauty and horror at the same time. Beauty through the muscular form and hairless skin, but horror from the mutilation and highly contrasted deformities in this piece. (Postcolonial Grotesque, pg.3) These figures are also missing the main components of how people communicate. Our ears and voice allow us to interpret and respond to each other in conversation. This represents the silencing of the south african community. (Postcolonial Grotesque, pg.3)
